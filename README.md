# Data-Completeness

The dataset used is the WikiTables Dataset
https://github.com/ppasupat/WikiTableQuestions/

Create_schema notebook is to be run in all_csv folder(a copy is already present in that folder), it creates schema as json objects in a txt file and the names of the files that do not get parsed are stored in an error file
